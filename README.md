[MOD MADE BY AFROMAN. PORTED BY SOLID_AROD (TESTED TO WORK BUT NO DEBUG SUPPORT)]

Guesstimation at its finest

Shows estimated range of a SAM's radar based on your current radar cross section. Updates in real time as you lose external weaponry

Notes:

-The estimation is based on the F-45's starboard(right) radar cross section (a worst case scenario)

-Keep in mind, you are way more stealthy facing directly towards or away from the radar, so you can still enter the SAM circle without being detected
